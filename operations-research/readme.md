formulation of the practical task:

You are in charge of planning the production of a chemical product for the next four months. The monthly demand and the purchasing unit costs of raw material are listed in Table. The capacity of the plant is of 1,300 tonnes (t.) per month. The demand of a month can be covered with the production of the same month, and also with production of past months. The storage costs are of 2 k€ per tonne stocked at the end of the month. The stock of finished product at the beginning of the first month is of 200 tonnes, and it is expected to hold the same quantity at the end of the fourth month. There are no stocks of raw material, so all stocks are of finished product.

Month             1    2     3    4
Costs (k€/t)      3    8     6    7
Demand (t)       800  900  1200  1800

Obtain the linear programming model that allows to obtain the production plan which minimizes the sum of production and storage costs. Then answer the following questions:

1. ﻿﻿﻿What number of tonnes should be produced on second month?
2. ﻿﻿﻿What number of tonnes should be in stock at the end of third month?
﻿﻿﻿3. What is the optimal sum of production and storage costs? What is the percent of storage costs?
﻿﻿﻿4. How will the optimal sum of costs change if needed quantity of stock at the end of the four month is rising to 300 tonnes?
﻿﻿﻿5. Let the needed quantity of stock at the end of the fourth month vary from 0 to 1000 tonnes (ch the step yourself). How would the optimal sum of costs vary? Illustrate with an appropriate graphics.
6. ﻿﻿﻿Give the meaningful interpretation of the dual variable (choose the one you want).
